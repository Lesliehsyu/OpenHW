Any current Xilinx platform, including [**PYNQ**](http://www.pynq.io/), and [**Alveo**](https://www.xilinx.com/products/boards-and-kits/alveo.html), can be used for the Open Hardware Design Contest. Participants can also enter using Amazon AWS EC2 F1, Nimbix, and other cloud providers.

Teams can use any platform supported by the Vivado design suite. 

XUP FPGA boards include the Basys 3, the Nexys 4 DDR, and the Nexys Video.

Recommended Zynq and Zynq Ultrascale+ boards include the PYNQ-Z1, PYNQ-Z2, ZUC104, and Ultra96 from Avnet.

[**Vivado**](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) and [**Vitis**](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis.html) software can be used.

Vitis is a new unified software platform that enables a broad range of developers - including software engineers and AI scientists - to take advantage of the power of hardware adaptability. 

Vitis is free-or-charge and available to download from [**www.xilinx.com/downloads**](www.xilinx.com/downloads)

# PYNQ platforms

![PYNQ_1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/PYNQ_2.png)

PYNQ is an open-source project that makes it easier to use Xilinx platforms.

Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of Xilinx platfroms to build more capable systems.

For more on PYNQ see [www.pynq.io](https://www.pynq.io/)
